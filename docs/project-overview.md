# Organic Chemistry Quiz Game: Project Overview

## Executive Summary

The Organic Chemistry Quiz Game is an interactive web-based educational application designed to help students learn organic chemistry reaction mechanisms through an engaging drag-and-drop interface. The application allows users to select reagents and place them in reaction slots to complete organic chemistry reactions, providing immediate feedback, detailed explanations, and progress tracking.

The game is built using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) with a focus on cross-platform compatibility, responsive design, and accessibility. It features an intuitive drag-and-drop interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices, audio feedback, and detailed chemistry notes for each reaction.
