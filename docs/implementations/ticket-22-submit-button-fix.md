# Implementation: Ticket #22 - Fix Submit Button Bug After Correct Answer

**Implementation Date:** April 12, 2025
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Related Tickets:** None

## Overview
Fixed a bug where users could artificially inflate their score by clicking the submit button multiple times after getting a correct answer. The fix ensures the submit button is properly disabled after a correct answer and re-enabled when moving to the next question.

## Implementation Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The bug occurred because the submit button remained enabled after a correct answer was submitted. While the drag-and-drop functionality and reset button were properly disabled, the submit button could still be clicked, triggering the success feedback and score increment multiple times.

### Changes Made
The implementation adds two key changes:

1. Disable the submit button after a correct answer in the handleSubmit function
2. Re-enable the submit button when moving to a new question in the handleNextQuestion function

### Files Modified

#### js/app.js
- Added submit button disable functionality in handleSubmit function:
```javascript
if (isCorrect) {
    // ...existing code...
    const submitButton = document.getElementById('submit-btn');
    submitButton.disabled = true;
    submitButton.classList.add('disabled');
}
```

- Added submit button re-enable functionality in handleNextQuestion function:
```javascript
if (nextQuestionLoaded) {
    // ...existing code...
    const submitButton = document.getElementById('submit-btn');
    submitButton.disabled = false;
    submitButton.classList.remove('disabled');
}
```

## Testing Performed
1. Basic Functionality Testing:
   - Verified submit button is disabled immediately after a correct answer
   - Confirmed submit button is properly re-enabled when moving to next question
   - Checked that submit button remains enabled after incorrect answers

2. Edge Case Testing:
   - Tested behavior when rapidly clicking submit button before disable takes effect
   - Verified score only increments once per correct answer
   - Confirmed audio feedback only plays once per correct answer

3. UI Testing:
   - Verified visual disabled state of submit button matches other disabled buttons
   - Confirmed disabled state is properly cleared when moving to next question

## Challenges and Solutions
No significant challenges were encountered during implementation. The fix follows the same pattern already established for the reset button, ensuring consistency in the UI behavior.

## Future Considerations
1. Consider implementing a debounce mechanism for the submit button to prevent rapid clicking before the disable takes effect
2. Consider adding animation to the disabled state transition for better user feedback
3. Monitor for any edge cases where the button state might get out of sync
