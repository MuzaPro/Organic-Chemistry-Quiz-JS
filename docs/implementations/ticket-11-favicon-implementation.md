# Implementation: Ticket #11 - Favicon Implementation

**Implementation Date:** April 12, 2025
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Related Tickets:** N/A

## Overview
Added favicon support to the Organic Chemistry Quiz application to improve its professional appearance and brand identity in browser tabs and bookmarks.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
The implementation involved updating the HTML head section to include proper favicon links. The implementation uses both standard `icon` and `shortcut icon` link tags for maximum browser compatibility.

### Files Modified

#### index.html
```html
<!-- Added to the head section -->
<link rel="icon" href="assets/images/favicon.png" type="image/png">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="assets/images/favicon.png" type="image/png">
```

## Testing Performed
- Verified favicon appearance in major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Confirmed favicon displays in browser tabs
- Tested favicon appearance in bookmarks
- Validated in both development and production environments

## Challenges and Solutions
No significant challenges were encountered during implementation. The existing favicon asset was already in the correct format and location.

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding additional favicon sizes for better mobile device support
- Could add Apple touch icon support for iOS devices
- May want to add SVG favicon support in the future for better scaling
