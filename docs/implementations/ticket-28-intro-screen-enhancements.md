**Implementation Date:** April 12, 2025
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Related Tickets:** #16 (Original Intro Screen), #17 (Dynamic Background)

## Overview
Enhanced the intro screen's visual consistency with the main quiz interface by replacing the inline SVG icon with the favicon.svg and extending the dynamic background to the intro screen.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. Replaced the inline SVG icon in the intro screen with the favicon.svg image
2. Added dynamic background to the intro screen
3. Enhanced text readability with semi-transparent background and blur effect

### Files Modified

#### index.html
- Replaced inline SVG with favicon.svg image element
- Maintained accessibility with proper alt text

#### css/styles.css
- Updated intro screen background handling
- Enhanced content container with backdrop blur and semi-transparent background
- Ensured proper text contrast and readability
- Maintained responsive design across all screen sizes

## Testing Performed
1. Visual Testing:
   - Verified favicon.svg display
   - Confirmed dynamic background appearance
   - Checked text readability against background
   - Validated layout on different screen sizes

2. Browser Compatibility:
   - Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verified SVG rendering consistency
   - Confirmed backdrop-filter support and fallbacks

3. Performance Testing:
   - Monitored initial load time
   - Verified smooth transitions
   - Checked background animation performance

## Challenges and Solutions
1. **Background Consistency:**
   - Challenge: Maintaining visual consistency between intro screen and main quiz area
   - Solution: Applied the same dynamic background styling and animation parameters

2. **Text Readability:**
   - Challenge: Ensuring text remains readable against the animated background
   - Solution: Implemented semi-transparent background with blur effect for better contrast

## Future Considerations
1. **Potential Enhancements:**
   - Consider adding theme-specific background variations
   - Explore progressive enhancement for browsers without backdrop-filter support
   - Consider adding subtle entrance animations for background elements

2. **Maintenance Notes:**
   - Monitor backdrop-filter browser support
   - Keep favicon.svg in sync with any brand updates
   - Consider performance optimizations for lower-end devices
