## Overview
The Question Navigation feature allows users to progress through the quiz efficiently, with a clear visual hierarchy that guides them through the correct interaction sequence. The system uses visual state management to indicate the primary action (Submit) while maintaining the option to proceed to the next question.

## Technical Implementation
- Uses visual state management to guide user interactions
- Integrates with the quiz engine's question management system
- Maintains score tracking system integrity
- Preserves accessibility through semantic HTML and ARIA attributes

## User Experience
1. Initial Question State:
   - Submit button appears prominent (primary styling, enhanced weight)
   - Next Question button appears subdued (secondary styling, reduced opacity)

2. After Submit Click:
   - Next Question button transitions to primary styling
   - Clear visual feedback indicates progression path
   - Submit button disables after correct answers
   - Error feedback shown for invalid submissions

3. Next Question Transition:
   - Resets button states for new question
   - Maintains consistent interaction pattern
   - Preserves user's mental model of quiz flow

## Button States
### Submit Button
- Primary styling with enhanced visual weight
- Box shadow for depth
- Disabled state after correct answers
- Clear active/hover states

### Next Question Button
- Secondary styling initially (reduced opacity)
- Transitions to primary after submission
- Animated arrow icon indicates direction
- Resets to secondary on new questions

## Accessibility Features

- Clear focus indicators
- Screen reader announcements
- Keyboard navigation support
- ARIA attributes for state changes

## Configuration Options
- Button styling configurable via CSS custom properties
- Visual state transitions customizable

## Known Limitations

- Must complete quiz in sequential order

## Future Enhancements
