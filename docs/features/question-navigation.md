## Overview
The Question Navigation feature allows users to progress through the quiz efficiently, with options to retry questions or move forward after incorrect answers. This feature enhances user experience by reducing frustration and allowing users to complete the quiz even when stuck on particular questions.

## Technical Implementation
- Uses the existing quiz engine's question management system
- Integrates with the score tracking system (no points awarded for skipped questions)
- Leverages the quiz UI feedback system for clear user communication
- Maintains consistent state management across question transitions

## User Experience
1. **Correct Answers:**
   - Shows success feedback
   - Displays "Next Question" button
   - Disables drag-and-drop and reset functionality

2. **Incorrect Answers:**
   - Shows error feedback
   - Displays "Next Question" button
   - Shows skip message explaining options
   - Maintains drag-and-drop functionality for retries
   - Keeps reset functionality active

## Configuration Options
The feature uses existing quiz configuration with no additional settings required. It integrates with:
- Question feedback messages from questions.json
- UI theme variables for consistent styling
- Existing button and feedback container elements

## Known Limitations
- No built-in tracking of skipped questions
- Cannot return to previously skipped questions in current implementation
- Score calculation treats skipped questions same as incorrect answers

## Future Enhancements
1. **Question Review Mode**
   - Add ability to mark questions for later review
   - Implement end-of-quiz review for skipped questions

2. **Analytics Integration**
   - Track commonly skipped questions
   - Gather metrics on retry attempts vs skips

3. **Adaptive Features**
   - Implement difficulty adjustment based on skip patterns
   - Add contextual hints for frequently skipped questions
