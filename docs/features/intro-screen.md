## Overview
The intro screen provides users with their first interaction with the Organic Chemistry Quiz Game. It welcomes users, sets expectations, and provides a clear entry point to start the quiz.

## Technical Implementation
- Implemented as a fixed-position overlay using CSS
- Uses favicon.svg as the main icon
- Incorporates the app's dynamic background with chemistry-themed animations
- Semi-transparent content area with backdrop blur for improved readability
- Smooth transitions between intro screen and quiz interface

## User Experience
- Displays immediately when the application loads
- Shows a welcoming message explaining the quiz purpose
- Features a prominent "Start Quiz" button
- Provides clear instructions about the drag-and-drop mechanics
- Ensures text remains readable against the animated background

## Configuration Options
- Icon size adjusts responsively based on screen size
- Background animation respects user's motion preferences
- Content area adapts to different viewport dimensions
- Supports both light and dark themes (when implemented)

## Known Limitations
- Backdrop-filter blur effect may not be supported in older browsers
- SVG icon requires proper fallback for unsupported browsers
- Animation performance may vary on low-end devices

## Future Enhancements
- Add theme-specific background variations
- Consider adding quiz difficulty selection
