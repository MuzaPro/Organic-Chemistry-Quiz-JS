## Overview
The Audio System provides sound effects feedback for key interactions in the Organic Chemistry Quiz application. It enhances the user experience through audio cues while maintaining performance and accessibility.

## Technical Implementation
The system is implemented through the `AudioManager` module in `audio.js`, which provides a clean API for playing sounds and managing audio preferences.

### Core Components

#### 1. Sound Management
```javascript
const sounds = {
    pickup: new Audio('assets/sound/pickup_card.mp3'),
    drop: new Audio('assets/sound/drop_card.mp3'),
    correct: new Audio('assets/sound/correct_answer.mp3'),
    wrong: new Audio('assets/sound/wrong_answer.mp3')
};
```

#### 2. Public API
- `AudioManager.initialize()`: Set up sound system and mute button
- `AudioManager.play(soundName)`: Play a specific sound effect
- `AudioManager.toggleMute()`: Toggle mute state

### Integration Points
- Drag-and-drop interactions (`drag-drop.js`)
- Answer submission feedback (`app.js`)
- Global mute toggle (Footer UI)

## User Experience
The audio system provides feedback for:
1. Picking up a molecule card
2. Dropping a molecule in a drop zone
3. Submitting correct answers
4. Submitting incorrect answers

Users can control the audio experience through a mute button in the footer, and their preference persists across sessions.

## Configuration Options
- Sound volume is preset to 50%
- Mute state is stored in `localStorage` as 'quizSoundMuted'
- Sound files are loaded from the `assets/sound/` directory

## Known Limitations
1. **Browser Restrictions**
   - iOS requires user interaction before playing audio
   - Some mobile browsers restrict autoplay
   - Legacy browsers may not support the Audio API

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Sound files should be kept small (< 100KB)
   - Multiple simultaneous sounds may not play well on mobile devices

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements include:
- Volume control slider
- Different sound themes
- Haptic feedback for mobile devices
- Web Audio API integration for advanced effects
- Sound sprites for better performance
- Preloader for sound assets

## Usage Example
```javascript
// Initialize the audio system
AudioManager.initialize();

// Play a sound effect
AudioManager.play('correct');

// Toggle mute state
AudioManager.toggleMute();
```

## Best Practices
1. **Sound Design**
   - Keep sound effects brief (< 500ms)
   - Use consistent volume levels
   - Ensure sounds are non-intrusive

2. **Implementation**
   - Always check for AudioManager existence before calling
   - Handle playback errors gracefully
   - Provide visual feedback alongside sounds

3. **Performance**
   - Preload sounds on initialization
   - Reuse Audio instances
   - Stop any playing sounds before starting new ones
