## Overview
The Audio System provides sound effects feedback for key interactions in the Organic Chemistry Quiz application. It enhances the user experience through audio cues while maintaining performance and accessibility.

## Technical Implementation
The system is implemented through the `AudioManager` module in `audio.js`, which provides a clean API for playing sounds and managing audio preferences.

### Core Components

#### 1. Sound Management
```javascript
const sounds = {
    pickup: new Audio('assets/sound/pickup_card.mp3'),
    drop: new Audio('assets/sound/drop_card.mp3'),
    correct: new Audio('assets/sound/correct_answer.mp3'),
    wrong: new Audio('assets/sound/wrong_answer.mp3')
};
```

#### 2. Public API
- `AudioManager.initialize()`: Set up sound system and mute button
- `AudioManager.play(soundName)`: Play a specific sound effect with error handling
- `AudioManager.toggleMute()`: Toggle mute state

### Error Handling
The system includes robust error handling for sound playback:
- Checks for AudioManager existence before attempting playback
- Handles mobile autoplay restrictions gracefully
- Provides fallback behavior when sound playback fails
- Prevents errors from disrupting touch interactions

### Integration Points
- Drag-and-drop interactions (`drag-drop.js`)
  - Mouse events: dragstart, drop
  - Touch events: panstart, panend, tap
- Answer submission feedback (`app.js`)
- Global mute toggle (Footer UI)

## User Experience
The audio system provides consistent feedback across all devices for:
1. Picking up a molecule card (mouse drag or touch pan)
2. Dropping a molecule in a drop zone
3. Submitting correct answers
4. Submitting incorrect answers

Users can control the audio experience through a mute button in the footer, and their preference persists across sessions.

## Configuration Options
- Sound volume is preset to 50%
- Mute state is stored in `localStorage` as 'quizSoundMuted'
- Sound files are loaded from the `assets/sound/` directory

## Known Limitations
1. **Browser Restrictions**
   - iOS requires user interaction before playing audio
   - Some mobile browsers restrict autoplay
   - Legacy browsers may not support the Audio API
   - Mobile sound limitations are handled gracefully with error catching

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Sound files should be kept small (< 100KB)
   - Multiple simultaneous sounds may not play well on mobile devices
   - Sound playback is asynchronous to prevent UI blocking
   - Error handling ensures smooth operation even when sound fails

## Best Practices
1. **Sound Design**
   - Keep sound effects brief (< 500ms)
   - Use consistent volume levels
   - Ensure sounds are non-intrusive

2. **Implementation**
   - Always use playSoundSafely wrapper for sound playback
   - Handle playback errors gracefully
   - Check for AudioManager existence before calls
   - Initialize audio system before touch events

3. **Performance**
   - Preload sounds on initialization
   - Reuse Audio instances
   - Stop any playing sounds before starting new ones
   - Handle mobile autoplay restrictions appropriately

## Mobile Integration
1. **Touch Event Handling**
   - Sound effects mirror mouse event equivalents
   - Error handling prevents touch disruption
   - Proper initialization order with Hammer.js
   - Consistent feedback across devices

2. **Mobile-Specific Considerations**
   - Autoplay restriction handling
   - Touch event synchronization
   - Performance optimization
   - Fallback behavior when sound fails

## Future Enhancements
- Volume control slider
- Different sound themes
- Haptic feedback for mobile devices
- Web Audio API integration for advanced effects
- Sound sprites for better performance
- Preloader for sound assets
- Sound playback status monitoring
