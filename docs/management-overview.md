## Project Overview for Non-Technical Stakeholders

### What It Does
The Organic Chemistry Quiz Game presents students with chemistry reaction questions where they must select the correct reagents to complete a given reaction. Users drag molecules from a "reagent bank" into reaction slots, submit their answer, and receive immediate feedback. Detailed chemistry notes are available for each reaction to help students understand the underlying mechanisms.

### Key Features
1. **Interactive Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Users physically move molecule cards to answer questions
2. **Multiple Reaction Types**: Covers important organic chemistry reactions including substitution, elimination, and synthesis reactions
3. **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bar and scoring system
4. **Detailed Feedback**: Explanations for both correct and incorrect answers
5. **Chemistry Notes**: In-depth explanations of reaction mechanisms
6. **Mobile Support**: Works on smartphones and tablets
7. **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback enhances the interactive experience

### How It Works (Simplified)
1. The application loads a set of chemistry questions
2. A question is presented showing the desired product of a reaction
3. The user drags the correct reagents into reaction slots
4. Upon submission, the answer is evaluated and feedback is provided
5. The user can progress to the next question or try again
6. After completing all questions, the user receives a score and feedback

### Current Status
The application is fully functional and deployed online, with ongoing enhancements in Phase 2 of development. Recent improvements include:
- Mobile touch compatibility
- Audio feedback system
- Enhanced user interface
- Improved question navigation

## System Architecture (Simplified)

The application is built using a modular structure that separates different aspects of functionality:
