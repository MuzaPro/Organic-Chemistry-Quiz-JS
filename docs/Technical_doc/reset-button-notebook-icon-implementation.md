# Reset Button and Icon Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document details the implementation of two UI enhancements:
1. Adding a notebook icon to the Chemistry Notes button
2. Reset button functionality improvements with refresh icon

## Changes Made

### 1. Reset Button Functionality
The reset button now becomes disabled after a correct answer to prevent score exploitation.

#### Files Modified:
- **app.js**:
  - Added reset button disable/enable logic in `handleSubmit` function
  - Added re-enabling logic in `handleNextQuestion` function
  - The button is disabled when an answer is correct
  - The button is re-enabled when moving to the next question

- **styles.css**:
  - Added `.btn:disabled` and `.btn.disabled` styles
  - Added opacity and cursor changes for disabled state
  - Added `pointer-events: none` to prevent interaction with disabled buttons
  - Added specific styles for disabled icon state

### 2. Icon Implementations
Both the Reset and Chemistry Notes buttons now have SVG icons.

#### Files Modified:
- **index.html**:
  - Added SVG refresh icon to reset button
  - Added SVG notebook icon to chemistry notes button
  - Icons are inline SVG elements for better control and performance
  - Both icons use consistent sizing (16x16) and styling

- **styles.css**:
  - Added `.btn-icon` class for icon styling
  - Added icon positioning and alignment styles
  - Added hover state styles for icons
  - Added consistent margins and vertical alignment
  - Icons change color with button states (normal, hover, disabled)

## CSS Classes
- `.btn-icon`: Base class for button icons
- `.btn-secondary .btn-icon`: Specific styling for secondary button icons
- `.btn-secondary:hover .btn-icon`: Hover state styling for icons
- `.btn-secondary:disabled .btn-icon`: Disabled state styling for icons

## Technical Decisions
1. **Inline SVG vs Image Files**:
   - Used inline SVG for immediate loading
   - Better control over icon colors through CSS
   - No additional HTTP requests needed

2. **Disabled State Implementation**:
   - Combined both `disabled` attribute and `.disabled` class
   - Used `pointer-events: none` to ensure no interactions in disabled state
   - Maintained visual consistency with other disabled elements

## Testing Considerations
1. Verify reset button becomes disabled after correct answer
2. Verify reset button is re-enabled on next question
3. Check icon appearance across different screen sizes
4. Verify icon color changes on button states
5. Test button states in all major browsers

## Accessibility
- Icons are decorative and use empty alt text
- Buttons remain keyboard accessible
- Color contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- Disabled states are properly indicated to screen readers

## Browser Support
Tested and working in:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
