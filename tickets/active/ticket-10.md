# Ticket #10: Add Next Question Option After Incorrect Answers

**STATUS: CLOSED - April 11, 2025**
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Original Estimate:** 0.5 day
**Actual Time:** 0.5 day
**Files Modified:**
- `js/app.js`
- `css/styles.css`

## Description
Currently, when users answer a question incorrectly, they are forced to either keep trying or close the game. We need to allow users to move to the next question even after an incorrect answer, improving user experience and reducing frustration.

## Priority
**Must Have** - Important user experience improvement

## Tasks
1. Modify the feedback system to display the "Next Question" button after incorrect answers
2. Update the UI to show this button appropriately
3. Implement the logic to move to the next question without awarding points
4. Ensure the current question is properly marked as incorrect in the scoring system

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] "Next Question" button appears after submitting an incorrect answer
- [ ] Users can proceed to the next question without having to answer the current one correctly
- [ ] The question is marked as incorrect in the scoring system (no points awarded)
- [ ] UI clearly indicates the answer was incorrect before allowing progression
- [ ] The experience feels natural and intuitive

## Implementation Notes
```javascript
// In handleSubmit function in app.js, modify the else clause:
if (isCorrect) {
    // Existing correct answer code...
} else {
    showFeedback(QuizEngine.getCurrentQuestion().incorrectFeedback, 'error');
    
    // Show next button even after incorrect answer
    document.getElementById('next-btn').classList.remove('hidden');
    
    // Optional: Add text indicating they can try again or move on
    document.getElementById('feedback-container').innerHTML += 
        '<p class="skip-text">You can try again or move to the next question.</p>';
}
```

```css
/* Add to styles.css */
.skip-text {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    margin-top: 10px;
    color: var(--dark-gray);
    font-style: italic;
}
```

## Testing Steps
1. Answer a question incorrectly and verify the "Next Question" button appears
2. Click the "Next Question" button and confirm it loads the next question
3. Verify no points are awarded for the skipped question
4. Complete the quiz with some skipped questions and verify the final score is correct
5. Test the feature across multiple browsers and devices
