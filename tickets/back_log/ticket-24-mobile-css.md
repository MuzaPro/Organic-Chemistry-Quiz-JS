# Ticket #24: Implement Mobile-Responsive CSS for Organic Chemistry Quiz

**Priority:** High  
**Type:** Enhancement  
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days  
**Assigned To:** Senior Developer  
**Created:** April 12, 2025

## Description

The Organic Chemistry Quiz application currently has significant usability issues on mobile devices. Users on smartphones cannot view all critical UI elements simultaneously, and the layout breaks in both portrait and landscape orientations. A previous attempt to implement a mobile.js solution failed, so we're now pursuing a CSS-first approach.

## Current Issues

- **Portrait Mode:** Limited visibility of UI elements, partial view of reagent bank, cut-off question text
- **Landscape Mode:** Header/footer not visible, some UI elements cut off
- **General:** Fixed-sized components, lack of proper overflow handling, insufficient layout adaptation

## Screenshots

Refer to the attached screenshots showing the current state on:
1. iPad Pro (acceptable but can be improved)
2. Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra portrait (broken layout)
3. Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra landscape (partial visibility)

## Requirements

Implement a mobile-friendly CSS solution that:

1. Works across all device sizes (phones to tablets)
2. Functions properly in both portrait and landscape orientations
3. Ensures all critical elements are accessible (questions, reactions, reagents)
4. Maintains the drag-and-drop functionality
5. Provides touch-optimized interactions
6. Uses a single codebase with responsive design

## Implementation Approach

Follow the detailed Mobile CSS Implementation Plan that has been provided separately. The plan includes:

1. Base structure modifications using flexbox
2. Mobile-specific layout adaptations
3. Component-specific optimizations
4. Touch interaction enhancements
5. Minimal JavaScript enhancements

## Testing Criteria

The implementation should be tested on:

- Small phones (iPhone SE, Galaxy S20)
- Medium phones (iPhone 13, Pixel 6)
- Large phones (iPhone Pro Max, Galaxy Ultra)
- Tablets (iPad Mini, iPad, Galaxy Tab)
- Multiple browsers (Safari iOS, Chrome Android/iOS, Samsung Internet)
- Both portrait and landscape orientations

## Acceptance Criteria

1. All UI elements are accessible on mobile devices
2. Drag-and-drop functionality works on touch devices
3. Layout adapts appropriately to both portrait and landscape orientations
4. Quiz is fully playable on smartphones
5. Performance is acceptable on lower-end devices
6. No regression of existing functionality on desktop

- Project Structure document (see project documentation)
- Current HTML structure in index.html
- Current CSS in styles.css

## Implementation Notes

- Focus on CSS changes first before adding any JavaScript enhancements
- Use Chrome DevTools device emulation for initial testing
- Test on actual devices before considering the implementation complete
- Document any HTML structure changes required
- Consider progressive enhancement for optimal experience across devices
