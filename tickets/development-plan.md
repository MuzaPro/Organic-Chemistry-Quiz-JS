# Organic Chemistry Quiz Game - Development Plan
**Version 1.0 | April 11, 2025**

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for the Organic Chemistry Quiz Game enhancements over the next two weeks. Following a thorough review of the existing codebase and requirements, we have prioritized the necessary improvements using the MoSCoW framework and organized them into two focused sprints.

The primary goals of this development cycle are to:
1. Resolve critical scientific accuracy issues and functional bugs
2. Improve mobile usability and responsiveness
3. Enhance the user experience with engaging visual and audio features
4. Maintain the educational integrity of the application

## MoSCoW Prioritization Analysis

### Must Have
These items are critical to the proper functioning and educational value of the application:

- **Scientific accuracy corrections**: As an educational tool, factual accuracy is paramount
- **Reset button fix**: Current implementation allows score manipulation
- **Mobile drop zone bug**: Severely impacts mobile usability
- **Next question option after incorrect answers**: Prevents user frustration

### Should Have
These items significantly improve the user experience but aren't critical to core functionality:

- **Favicon implementation**: Enhances professional appearance and brand recognition
- **Notebook icon for Chemistry Notes**: Improves UI clarity
- **Mobile screen optimization**: Important for a growing segment of users

### Could Have
These enhancements would add value but can be deprioritized if needed:

- **Certificate for perfect completion**: Gamification element
- **Sound effects system**: Enhances engagement
- **Intro screen**: Improves first-time user experience
- **Dynamic background**: Visual enhancement
- **Decorative chemistry art**: Thematic visual enhancement

### Won't Have (This Release)
Features deferred to future development cycles:

- **Dark mode**: While valuable, this is lower priority than other improvements
- **Additional question types**: Will be considered after scientific accuracy is resolved
- **User accounts and progress tracking**: Requires backend development beyond scope

## Development Guidelines

### Coding Standards
- Maintain modular architecture with separate concerns
- Document all functions with descriptive comments
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Test across multiple browsers after each feature implementation

### Testing Requirements
- Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile device testing: iOS Safari and Android Chrome
- Verify functionality in both portrait and landscape orientations
- Ensure proper fallbacks for unsupported features
- Validate accessibility for keyboard navigation

### Git Workflow
- Create feature branches for each ticket: `feature/ticket-7-scientific-accuracy`
- Include ticket number in commit messages: "TICKET-7: Fix reaction mechanism descriptions"
- Request code review before merging to development branch
- Maintain clean commit history with meaningful messages
