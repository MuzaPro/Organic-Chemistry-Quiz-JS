**Priority:** High  
**Type:** UX Enhancement  
**Estimate:** 1 hour  
**Assigned to:** Unassigned  
**Related Ticket:** #27 (Enhance Next Question Button Styling)

## Description
Despite the successful implementation of Ticket #27's visual enhancements, users are experiencing confusion with the Next Question button. The button is either (1) appearing simultaneously with the Submit button or (2) is too visually similar to the Submit button when it does appear, causing users to miss the Submit button and click Next Question instead. This ticket aims to resolve this UX issue while preserving the visual improvements and accessibility features implemented in Ticket #27.

## Background
Ticket #27 successfully enhanced the Next Question button by:
- Changing it from btn-secondary to btn-primary class
- Adding a right arrow SVG icon with animation
- Ensuring proper responsive behavior
- Maintaining accessibility standards

According to the implementation report, the button was intended to maintain its "existing show/hide functionality in the quiz flow," but user testing indicates there's still confusion in the interaction sequence.

## Current Behavior
- The Next Question button appears in a way that competes visually with the Submit button
- Users are clicking Next Question instead of Submit
- Users aren't getting feedback on their answers before moving to the next question
- The overall quiz flow is disrupted by this interaction issue

## Requirements
Implement Solution 1 (preferred) OR Solution 2 to resolve the UX issue while preserving the visual enhancements and accessibility features from Ticket #27:

### Solution 1: Enforce Strict Button Visibility Sequencing (Preferred)
1. Ensure the Next Question button is always hidden when a new question is loaded
2. Only reveal the Next Question button after the Submit button has been clicked
3. Show the Next Question button regardless of whether:
   - The answer was correct or incorrect
   - The drop zones were filled or empty (show appropriate error feedback)
4. Preserve all visual enhancements from Ticket #27 (primary styling, arrow icon, animation)
5. Maintain all accessibility features (screen reader support, keyboard navigation)

### Solution 2: Create Clear Visual Hierarchy
1. Keep the Next Question button initially visible but style it as a secondary button
2. After Submit is clicked, change the Next Question to primary styling
3. Consider additional visual enhancements to distinguish Submit as the primary action:
   - Increased font weight for Submit
   - Subtle shadow for Submit
   - Reduced opacity for Next Question when in secondary state
4. Preserve the arrow icon and animation from Ticket #27
5. Maintain all accessibility features

## Implementation Details for Solution 1 (Preferred)

### JavaScript Changes
Modify the application flow to ensure proper button visibility:

```javascript
// When loading a new question, always hide the Next button
function loadQuestion(index) {
    // Existing question loading code...
    
    // Ensure Next button is hidden
    document.getElementById('next-btn').classList.add('hidden');
    
    // Ensure Submit button is enabled and visible
    const submitBtn = document.getElementById('submit-btn');
    submitBtn.disabled = false;
    submitBtn.classList.remove('hidden');
}

// Always show Next button after Submit is clicked
function handleSubmit() {
    // Get drop zone content
    const dropZone1Content = DragDrop.getDropZoneContent(1);
    const dropZone2Content = DragDrop.getDropZoneContent(2);
    
    // Show appropriate feedback
    if (!dropZone1Content || !dropZone2Content) {
        showFeedback('Please place both reactants before submitting.', 'error');
    } else {
        // Check answer and show feedback
        const isCorrect = QuizEngine.checkAnswer([dropZone1Content.reagentId, dropZone2Content.reagentId]);
        
        if (isCorrect) {
            // Handle correct answer...
            DragDrop.setDraggingEnabled(false);
        } else {
            // Handle incorrect answer...
        }
    }
    
    // Always show Next button after Submit is clicked
    document.getElementById('next-btn').classList.remove('hidden');
}

// Reset button states when moving to next question
function handleNextQuestion() {
    // Existing next question code...
    
    // Hide Next button when loading new question
    document.getElementById('next-btn').classList.add('hidden');
}
```

### No HTML/CSS Changes Required
The visual enhancements from Ticket #27 should be preserved without modification.

## Implementation Details for Solution 2 (Alternative)

### HTML Change
Update the Next button to start with secondary styling:
```html
<button id="next-btn" class="btn btn-secondary">
  <span>Next Question</span>
  <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" width="24" height="24" stroke-width="2" class="next-icon">
    <path d="M5 12l14 0"></path>
    <path d="M13 18l6 -6"></path>
    <path d="M13 6l6 6"></path>
  </svg>
</button>
```

### CSS Updates
Add styles to create clear visual distinction:
```css
/* Make Submit button more prominent */
#submit-btn {
  font-weight: 600;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}

/* Style Next button as less prominent until activated */
#next-btn.btn-secondary {
  opacity: 0.85;
}

#next-btn.btn-primary {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### JavaScript Modifications
Change the Next button style when Submit is clicked:
```javascript
function handleSubmit() {
    // Existing submit code...
    
    // Change Next button to primary style
    const nextBtn = document.getElementById('next-btn');
    nextBtn.classList.remove('btn-secondary');
    nextBtn.classList.add('btn-primary');
}

function handleNextQuestion() {
    // Existing next question code...
    
    // Reset to secondary style for new question
    const nextBtn = document.getElementById('next-btn');
    nextBtn.classList.remove('btn-primary');
    nextBtn.classList.add('btn-secondary');
}
```

## Test Cases
1. **Button Visibility Logic**
   - Verify Next button is hidden/secondary when question loads
   - Verify Next button appears/changes style after Submit is clicked
   - Test with both filled and empty drop zones

2. **Visual Clarity**
   - Verify users can clearly distinguish which button to press first
   - Test with different screen sizes and orientations

3. **Accessibility**
   - Verify screen reader announces buttons correctly
   - Check keyboard navigation works properly
   - Ensure focus states are clear

4. **Workflow**
   - Verify correct question sequence when using buttons
   - Check that all feedback is visible before moving to next question

- [ ] Users clearly understand they should click Submit before Next Question
- [ ] The visual enhancements from Ticket #27 are preserved
