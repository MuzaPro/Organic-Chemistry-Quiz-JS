## Description
There is a bug in the quiz application where users can repeatedly click the submit button after answering correctly to earn multiple points for a single question and trigger the correct answer sound effect multiple times. This ticket is to fix this bug by disabling the submit button after a correct answer.

## Resolution
The bug has been fixed by:
1. Adding submit button disable functionality in handleSubmit() after a correct answer
2. Adding submit button re-enable functionality in handleNextQuestion()
3. Maintaining consistency with existing button disable/enable patterns

All acceptance criteria have been met:
- [x] Submit button becomes disabled after a correct answer is submitted
- [x] Visual styling indicates that the submit button is disabled
- [x] Multiple clicks on submit after a correct answer do not increase the score
- [x] Multiple clicks do not trigger the correct sound effect repeatedly
- [x] Submit button is properly re-enabled when moving to the next question
- [x] User can still retry after an incorrect answer (submit button remains enabled)
