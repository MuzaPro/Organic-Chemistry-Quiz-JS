# Ticket #26: Fix Mobile Drag-Drop Issues

**STATUS: CLOSED - April 12, 2025**
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Original Estimate:** 2 hours
**Actual Time:** 2 hours
**Files Modified:**
- `js/drag-drop.js`

## Description
On mobile devices, molecules would sometimes disappear or get stuck when being dragged between drop zones. This bug severely impacted the mobile user experience, particularly on smaller screens like the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. The fix involved improving state management during drag operations and enhancing drop zone detection accuracy.

## Tasks
1. [x] Improve state management in drag-drop.js
2. [x] Enhance drop zone detection for better accuracy
3. [x] Fix molecule visibility issues during drag operations
4. [x] Add smooth transitions for failed drops
5. [x] Test thoroughly on mobile devices

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Molecules no longer disappear during drag operations
- [x] Molecules can be dragged between drop zones reliably
- [x] Drop zone detection is more forgiving on small screens
- [x] Visual feedback is smooth and responsive
- [x] Performance remains good on mobile devices

## Implementation Notes
The fix focused on three main areas:
1. Enhanced drop zone detection with a touch radius buffer
2. Improved state management during drag operations
3. Added smooth transitions for better visual feedback

## Testing Steps
1. Test basic drag-drop operations on mobile
2. Verify molecules don't disappear during transfers
3. Test rapid drag operations between zones
4. Verify visual feedback and transitions
5. Test on multiple screen sizes
