# Ticket #7: Scientific Accuracy Corrections

## Description
The organic chemistry quiz questions contain scientific inaccuracies identified by a specialist in the `questions_review.txt` file. These issues must be addressed to ensure educational integrity of the application.

## Priority
**Must Have** - Critical for an educational application

## Tasks
1. Review specialist feedback in `questions_review.txt`
2. Update `questions.json` with corrected chemistry information
3. Ensure consistency between questions, answers, and feedback texts
4. Update any affected molecule SVGs if necessary
5. Verify changes with subject matter expert if available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All scientific inaccuracies identified in the review have been corrected
- [ ] Question content accurately represents organic chemistry principles
- [ ] Feedback texts and chemistry notes contain correct scientific information
- [ ] Visual representations correctly match the chemical structures they represent

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on reaction mechanisms, reagent combinations, and chemical explanations
- Maintain consistency between different parts of each question (text, correct answers, feedback)
- Pay special attention to SN1/SN2 and E1/E2 reaction mechanisms
- Document any changes that significantly alter the quiz structure

## Testing Steps
1. Verify each corrected question against reference materials
2. Have at least one team member review the changes for accuracy
3. Test that all questions still function properly in the application
