# Ticket #17: Review Scientific Accuracy of Organic Chemistry Content

**STATUS: OPEN**
**Priority:** High
**Type:** Content Review
**Estimate:** 4 hours
**Assigned to:** Organic Chemistry Expert

## Description
As an educational tool, the Organic Chemistry Quiz Game must maintain high standards of scientific accuracy. This ticket requests a thorough review of all chemistry content in the questions.json file by a qualified organic chemistry expert to ensure all reactions, mechanisms, molecules, formulas, and explanations are scientifically accurate and follow current IUPAC conventions.

## Background
The application currently contains 5 questions covering various organic chemistry reactions:
1. Williamson Ether Synthesis
2. SN1 reaction forming tert-butyl ethyl ether
3. E2 elimination reaction
4. Esterification reaction
5. Grignard reaction

Each question includes:
- Reaction products with names, formulas, and structural representations
- Multiple reagent options with names, formulas, and structural representations
- Correct and incorrect feedback text
- Detailed chemistry notes explaining the reaction mechanisms

## Tasks
1. Review all molecule names for accuracy and IUPAC compliance
2. Verify chemical formulas match the described molecules
3. Examine reaction mechanisms described in the chemistry notes for accuracy
4. Verify correct reagent combinations for each reaction type
5. Check feedback text for scientific accuracy
6. Review textual representations of molecules for accuracy
7. Produce a detailed report documenting findings with specific corrections as needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete review of all 5 questions in questions.json
- [ ] Produce a detailed report with the following sections:
  - Executive summary of findings
  - Question-by-question analysis with specific corrections
  - List of any systematic issues found across multiple questions
  - Recommendations for improvement
  - Verification that corrected content meets scientific standards
- [ ] Corrections should follow current IUPAC nomenclature and conventions
- [ ] Report should include severity ratings for each issue (Critical, Major, Minor)
- [ ] Report should be written in markdown format for easy integration with documentation

## Additional Notes
- Focus on scientific accuracy rather than pedagogical approach
- Flag any advanced concepts that may need additional explanation
- Note any missing important variations of reactions that should be included
- Suggest additional reaction types that would be valuable to include in future questions

## Related Files
- `data/questions.json` - Primary file containing all chemistry content
- `assets/molecules/` - Directory containing molecule SVG files (names should be verified)

## Review Guidelines
When reviewing each question, please consider:

1. **Chemical Accuracy**
   - Are reactants and products chemically feasible?
   - Do the reaction conditions match standard practice?
   - Are the described mechanisms correct?

2. **Naming Conventions**
   - Do all molecule names follow IUPAC conventions?
   - Are common names used appropriately where applicable?

3. **Visual Representations**
   - Do molecular structures accurately represent the described compounds?
   - Are stereo-chemical features represented correctly if applicable?

4. **Educational Value**
   - Is the feedback scientifically accurate and helpful?
   - Do the chemistry notes provide an accurate explanation of the mechanism?

## Estimated Effort
High (4 hours) - Requires detailed scientific analysis by a domain expert

## Deliverable Format
The report should be submitted as a markdown file named `scientific_accuracy_review.md` for easy integration with our documentation system.
