# Ticket #11: Add Favicon to Quiz Application

## Description
The Organic Chemistry Quiz application needs a favicon to improve its professional appearance and brand identity in browser tabs and bookmarks. A studio logo is available at `assets/images/favicon_logo.png` that can be used for this purpose.

## Priority
**Should Have** - Important for professional appearance

## Tasks
1. Add appropriate favicon link tags to the `index.html` file
2. Ensure the favicon appears in browser tabs and bookmarks
3. Verify the favicon loads properly across different browsers

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Favicon appears in browser tabs when the quiz is loaded
- [ ] Favicon appears in bookmarks when the page is saved
- [ ] Implementation works across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Favicon loads properly in both development and production environments

## Implementation Notes
```html
<!-- Add to the <head> section of index.html -->
<link rel="icon" href="assets/images/favicon_logo.png" type="image/png">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="assets/images/favicon_logo.png" type="image/png">
```

For optimal cross-browser support, consider creating multiple sizes of the favicon:
1. 16x16 pixels (favicon-16x16.png)
2. 32x32 pixels (favicon-32x32.png)
3. 48x48 pixels (favicon-48x48.png)

And using a more comprehensive implementation:
```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="16x16" href="assets/images/favicon-16x16.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="assets/images/favicon-32x32.png">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="48x48" href="assets/images/favicon-48x48.png">
<link rel="shortcut icon" href="assets/images/favicon.ico">
```

## Testing Steps
1. Test favicon appearance in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
2. Verify favicon appears in browser tabs
3. Bookmark the page and verify the favicon appears in bookmarks
4. Test in both local development and production environments
