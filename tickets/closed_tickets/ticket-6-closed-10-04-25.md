# Ticket #6: Implement Touch Support with Hammer.js

**Type:** Enhancement  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimate:** 4 hours  
**Assigned to:** [AI Agent]  
**Branch:** feature/hammer.js  
**Related tickets:** Ticket #5 (previous touch implementation attempt)

## Description
The current drag-and-drop functionality in the Organic Chemistry Quiz Game works correctly on desktop browsers but fails on touch devices (tablets and smartphones). When users try to drag molecules on touch devices, the browser's context menu appears or the drag operation fails entirely. We need to implement a touch-compatible drag-and-drop system using the Hammer.js library.

## Background
Our previous implementation attempt (Ticket #5) using standard touch events was unsuccessful. Testing on both tablet and Android phone showed that while some drag operations could be initiated, they could not be completed successfully due to browser interference. After research, we've determined that Hammer.js offers the best chance of success for maintaining drag-and-drop functionality across all devices.

## User Story
As a student using the quiz on a mobile device,  
I want to be able to drag and drop molecules using touch gestures,  
So that I can complete the quiz exercises on my tablet or smartphone.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can drag molecules from the reagent bank to drop zones using touch gestures on mobile devices
2. Users can move molecules between drop zones using touch gestures
3. Users can return molecules to the reagent bank (by tapping molecules in drop zones)
4. The implementation works on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome
5. The existing mouse-based drag-and-drop functionality continues to work on desktop browsers
6. Dragged elements follow the user's finger position naturally
7. No browser context menus or selection interfaces appear during touch operations

## Technical Requirements
1. Add the Hammer.js library to the project
2. Modify the drag-drop.js file to implement touch handling with Hammer.js
3. Create a device detection system that applies the appropriate interaction model
4. Add touch-specific styles for visual feedback during drag operations
5. Prevent default browser behaviors that interfere with touch dragging
6. Ensure proper performance on lower-end mobile devices

## Implementation Notes
- Start with a fresh branch from main (feature/hammer.js)
- Refer to the attached implementation plan document for detailed guidance
- Use Hammer's pan events for drag operations
- Maintain backward compatibility with mouse events for desktop browsers
- Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices

## Definition of Done
- Code changes implemented according to the implementation plan
- Functionality tested on:
  - iOS Safari
  - Android Chrome
  - Desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- No regressions in existing desktop functionality
- Pull request submitted with detailed description of changes
