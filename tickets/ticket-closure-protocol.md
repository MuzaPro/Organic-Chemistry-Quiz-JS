# Ticket Closure Protocol

When a ticket has been successfully implemented, follow this protocol to properly document and close the ticket.

## 1. Update the Ticket Status

Locate the original ticket file in the `tickets/active/` directory and update it with closure information at the top:

```markdown
# Ticket #[NUMBER]: [Original Title]

**STATUS: CLOSED - [Current Date]**
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Original Estimate:** [Original Time Estimate]
**Actual Time:** [Approximate Implementation Time]
**Files Modified:** 
- `[filename1]`
- `[filename2]`

## Description
(original ticket content continues below)
```

## 2. Create Implementation Documentation

Create a new markdown file in `documentation/implementations/` with the following format:

```markdown
# Implementation: Ticket #[NUMBER] - [Brief Title]

**Implementation Date:** [Current Date]
**Implemented by:** VS Code AI Agent
**Related Tickets:** [Any related ticket numbers, if applicable]

## Overview
[Brief description of what was implemented and why]

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
[Detailed explanation of how the feature/fix was implemented]

### Files Modified

#### [filename1]
```[language]
// Key code changes with explanation
```

#### [filename2]
```[language]
// Other key changes with explanation
```

## Testing Performed
[Description of testing done to verify the implementation]

## Challenges and Solutions
[Any challenges encountered during implementation and how they were solved]

## Future Considerations

```

## 3. Move the Ticket File

Move the updated ticket file from `tickets/active/` to `tickets/closed/`.

## 4. Update Feature Documentation (If Needed)

If this ticket affects a core feature or creates a new feature, update or create the appropriate documentation in `documentation/features/`:

```markdown
# Feature: [Feature Name]

**Last Updated:** [Current Date]
**Related Tickets:** #[NUMBER], [other related tickets]

## Overview
[General description of the feature and its purpose]

## Technical Implementation
[How the feature is implemented in the codebase]

## User Experience
[How the feature behaves from a user perspective]

## Configuration Options
[Any configurable aspects of the feature]

## Known Limitations
[Any edge cases or limitations of the current implementation]

## Future Enhancements
[Planned or suggested improvements for the future]
```

## 5. Submit Changes

Commit your documentation changes with a message following this format:
```
Close Ticket #[NUMBER]: [Brief description of implementation]

- Updated ticket status
- Created implementation documentation
- [Any other actions taken]
```

## Example

For Ticket #8 (Fix Reset Button After Correct Answer):

1. Update `tickets/active/ticket-8.md` with closure information
2. Create `documentation/implementations/ticket-8-reset-button.md`
3. Move the updated ticket to `tickets/closed/ticket-8.md`
4. Update `documentation/features/reset-button.md` if needed
