Issues Found:
1. Question 3: E2 Elimination Reaction
Major Issue: The reaction between potassium tert-butoxide and 2-bromo-2-methylpropane (tert-butyl bromide) would not proceed via the E2 mechanism as indicated.
Why: 2-bromo-2-methylpropane is a tertiary alkyl halide with no β-hydrogens that can achieve the anti-periplanar geometry required for E2 elimination. This substrate would predominantly undergo SN1/E1 pathways instead.
Fix Required: Either:
Change the reaction type to E1 (which would be correct for this substrate)
Replace the substrate with a primary or secondary halide that has properly oriented β-hydrogens (like 2-bromopropane)


2. Question 5: Grignard Reaction
Major Issue: The product structure doesn't match the reagents.
Why: The reaction between phenylmagnesium bromide (C6H5-MgBr) and ethylene oxide would produce 1-phenylethanol (C6H5-CHOH-CH3), not 2-phenylethanol (C6H5-CH2-CH2-OH) as shown. The phenyl group would attach directly to one of the carbons from the epoxide.
Fix Required: Either:
Change the product to 1-phenylethanol to match the reagents
Change the Grignard reagent to benzylmagnesium bromide (C6H5-CH2-MgBr), which would correctly produce 2-phenylethanol



3. Question 2: SN1 Reaction
Minor Issue: While the main reagents (ethanol and tert-butyl chloride) are correct, SN1 reactions typically require acid catalysis to proceed efficiently, especially with alcohols as nucleophiles.
Suggestion: Consider adding an acid catalyst (H2SO4 or HCl) to the correct reagents or clarify in the notes that a catalyst would be needed in practice.
4. Question 4: Esterification
Minor Issue: Similar to Question 2, Fischer esterification typically requires an acid catalyst (H2SO4), which is mentioned in the notes but not included in the correct reagents.
Suggestion: Consider making the acid catalyst a required reagent, as this better represents real laboratory conditions for esterification reactions.
Correcting these issues, especially the major ones in Questions 3 and 5, will ensure that students learn accurate organic chemistry concepts and mechanisms through your quiz game.
